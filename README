PictureView is a PyGTK widget that can be used to build an application
that shows pictures, e.g. a photo browser.
Similar to the most dektop environments' picture viewers it has
controls to zoom (zoom in, zoom out, fit to window, original size) the
picture and to switch between pictures in a directory.
The widget is completly written in Python.

An example of a very basic picture viewer is located in the 'demo'
directory.
